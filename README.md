# Smith Normal Form Lean 3 Formalisation Project

This is my first project using Lean 3. I attempt to formalise Smith Normal Form as outlined in [Basic Algebra I](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~ila/Jacobson-Basic_algebra_I%20(1).pdf) by Jacobson (Theorem 3.8). This project was done under the supervision of [Prof. Dirk Schuetz](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/dirk.schuetz/) who was a great help with breaking the proofs down into managable chunks to formalise.

I used this project to learn Lean and as a consequence, I believe following the implementation in Jacobson, using an algorithm with elemntary matrices to show equivalences, is not ideal for Lean. If I was to redo this project, I would not implement elementary matrices, but instead only implement the (equivalence-preserving) map the elementary matrices induce.

I restricted the theorem for this project to only consider $n \times n$ matrices, although the full result was not implemented. The remaining steps to implement are:
